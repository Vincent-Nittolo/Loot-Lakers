# Loot Lakers

We have decided to make a game of Fortnite monopoly as the orignal board game was lack luster. To improve on the game we have decided to implement a material cost instead of a monetary cost to buy and build the locations and homes. This way it can capture more of the aspect of Fortnite as well as maintaning the feeling of monopoly.
